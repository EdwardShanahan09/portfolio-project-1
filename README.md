This is the refactored version of my Portfolio Project One, originally created for my Full Stack Development Diploma from Code Institute. While the original project utilized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this updated version is built with React.

With React, I've modularized the components, making the codebase more organized and easier to maintain. Additionally, React's virtual DOM enhances performance by efficiently updating only the necessary parts of the UI.

By leveraging React's component-based architecture, I've enhanced the project's scalability, allowing for easier integration of new features and improvements in the future. This refactor demonstrates my proficiency in utilizing modern web development frameworks to create robust and dynamic web applications.
