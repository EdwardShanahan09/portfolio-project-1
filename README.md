This is the refactored version of my Portfolio Project One, originally created for my Full Stack Development Diploma from Code Institute. While the original project utilized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this updated version is built with React.

With React, I've modularized the components, making the codebase more organized and easier to maintain. Additionally, React's virtual DOM enhances performance by efficiently updating only the necessary parts of the UI.

By leveraging React's component-based architecture, I've enhanced the project's scalability, allowing for easier integration of new features and improvements in the future. This refactor demonstrates my proficiency in utilizing modern web development frameworks to create robust and dynamic web applications.

# Ellie Mae Photography

This project is for a fictional photographer. Ellie Mae is a professional photographer who wants to share her best work and gain new clients through this website.

The website is one page and easy to navigate, it is very clean using minimal colours and fonts. The website is also responsive for different screen sizes.

The user will be able to learn about Ellie Mae with the about section, and see her photography work using a modern photo gallery. The user will be able to see a list of her services and a contact form to get in touch. Ellie Maeâ€™s social media accounts are also included on the website so users can keep up to date by following her.
